            As a woman who loves playing video games with family and friends, my experiences haven't been the greatest. With online games such as Overwatch or Call of Duty, when I would talk in the lobbies, the enviroment would become weird and many negative comments would start being said towards me. It becomes annoying and what I love to do no longer is fun. I have had these experiences many, many times so much so that I have gotten used to the offensive remarks, but I've become aware that that is not something that I should accept. Therefore, this website was created to bring awareness to the topic at hand, gender inequality, more specifically in the gaming industry. As the younger generation becomes more involved with video games, it is important for them to identify these inequalities and either stop themselves from reproducing them or stop others. This website provides numerous resources to get informed. Happy researching!
